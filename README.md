# SMS Spam Detection

SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying and classifying SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This project applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze SMS text content and make accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing of SMS text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained classifier to predict whether a message is spam or ham.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Model**: Trained machine learning model saved for use in production or further testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries from `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Moksh91119/sms-spam-classifier.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd sms-spam-classifier
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook sms-spam-detection.ipynb
    ```

2. **Run the cells** in the notebook to execute the code, preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

### Model Evaluation

The notebook contains model evaluation metrics, including:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Indicates the modelâ€™s ability to find all positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: Provides a balance between precision and recall.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrating a web or mobile interface for easier user interaction.
- Deploying the model to a cloud service for real-time predictions.
- Enhancing model performance with advanced NLP techniques.
